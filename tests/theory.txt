Mail-endpoint Theory of Operation
---

mail-endpoint uses parseq async js library to provide 
access to the mailerlite api for capturing and retrieving
email addresses.

Overview
--
Typical flow:
1. make a Tester using env variables
2. pass this tester into parseq.sequence
3. call parseq.sequence() with testRequest:
note: parseq.sequence takes an array of Requestors

parseq.sequence(
     //[makeTester(environmentVariables)]
     [makeTestRequestor(environmentVariables)]
   )(testRequest);

parseq.sequence creates a parallel factory that returns
a requestor function that, when called, returns an array of X

Objects used
---
environmentVariables: passed from process.env to makeTester.

makeTester: returns a testRequestor(callback) where callback


testRequest: A parseq request. Its a function that takes value,reason.
It does not return anything but calls assert to check for....


From parseq.mjs:560:
parseq.sequence = function sequence(requestor_array, milliseconds) {
